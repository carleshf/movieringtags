# movie ring tags

Inspired by [Shirley Wu](http://sxywu.com/)'s film flowers (:hibiscus:) and leaves (:leaves:), I created the movie (:movie_camera:) ring (:ring:) tags (:label:) as a data visualization experiment (:bar_chart:) about some of my favourite movie sagas.

To create this document I used for first time [d3js](https://d3js.org) (version 3). You can see the result document at: [https://carleshf.github.io/movieringtags/](https://carleshf.github.io/movieringtags/).
